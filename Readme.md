"#usage of essential patterns" 
22 of the Gang of Fours software design patterns

1. Abstract Factory Pattern - good for creating objects in different related families without relying on concrete implementations
2. Adapter pattern - good for adapting two interfaces together when one or more of those interfaces cannot be refactored
3. Bridge pattern - good for allowing lots of variation between implementations of interfaces
4. Facade pattern - good for hiding the complexity which cannot be refactored away
5. Factory Pattern - good for creating objects in a related family
6. Iterator pattern - good for extracting objects from a collection w/o exposing the collection itself
7. Observer pattern - good for notifying observer objects that a particular subject'state changed
8. Prototype pattern - good for creating lots of similar instances
9. Template method - good for creating an outline of an algorithm but letting the specific steps to be implemented by other classes
